      <h2>Education</h2>
      <h3>BS Computer Science, Purdue University</h3>
      <h5>2015-2019</h5>
      <p>I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with concentrations in Software Engineering and Machine Intelligence as well as a minor in Earth-Atmospheric Sciences.  Graduating with a GPA of 3.86, I attained Dean's List all 8 semesters of my college career at Purdue University (Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Fall 2016, Spring 2017, Fall 2017, Spring 2018, Fall 2018, Spring 2019).</p>

      <h5>Some of My Classes</h5>
      <p>My last semester at Purdue, I completed my two concentrations with my Software Engineer Senior Project and my Database Systems class.</p>
      <p>More about my completed senior project can be found at the Memoji page.  We designed a multiplayer game inspired by the Jackbox(tm) Party Pack series of games in which the game is hosted on a computer and players join using their phones of other devices.  In Memoji, the twist is that you answer prompts using only emojis.</p>
      <p>Database systems went into detail about, you guessed it, databases.  This covered some of the architecture and optimizations done in storing data and retrieving it as well as the theory behind in.  This finished up my electives for my concentration in Machine Intelligence / Artificial Intelligence.</p>
      <p>Machine Learning/Data Mining are trendy topics in the tech world today as "Big Data" continues to transform the industry.  I'm applying much of the knowledge that I learned in my job at Verizon Media I started June 2019.  This delves into the back-end systems behind the advertising analytics and data pipelines used to serve relevant ads to users of today's internet.</p>
      <p>In past semesters, I have taken my core computer science courses including Object Oriented Programming, Discrete Math, C Programming, Computer Architecture, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Systems Programming.</p>
      <p>To add to these, I have taken a selection of upper level courses including Software Engineering, Software Testing, Analysis of Algorithms, Operating Systems, Information Systems, Data Mining and Machine Learning, and Web Information Search and Retrieval.</p>
      <p>Most notably, Analysis of Algorithms is considered one of the most challenging courses at Purdue for Computer Science majors.  In this course, our assignments consisted of developing algorithms to solve problems in the most optimal fashion.  We needed to choose the best algorithms for the problems, often combining multiple of the ones we learn about in class to create our own solutions for the problems.</p>
      <p class="centered-text">*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *</p>
      <p>Outside of Computer Science, I also obtained a minor in Earth & Atmospheric Science.  Meteorology and the systems at play in Earth's atmosphere and biosphere have also been interesting to me, so I chose to take these courses to satisfy my desire to learn new things in the world of science - to add a bit of variety to my technologically focused curriculum!</p>
      <p>My second to last semester, I am took an upper level meteorology class, Atmospheric Thermodynamics, which delves further into the physics and chemistry of air parcels and heat as they move through the atmosphere.  I also took a space class called The Planets which covered a lot about our not-so-unique little solar system!  Incredibly interesting, there's actually a lot more to learn about our planets that what you know by third grade.  For example, did you know there is a hexagonal-shaped storm around Saturn's pole?  The more you know!</p>
      <p>Previously, I have taken Intro to Atmospheric Science, Earth Systems, Geology I, Atmospheric Physics, Climate Change, and Geologic History.</p>
      <p>I have also had the opportunity to take Entrepreneurship I and Entrepreneurship II here at Purdue which have been great team-building courses discussing the creation of business ideas, pitching to investors, and founding new companies.</p>
      <p>For fun, I took an Intro to Piano class before graduation.  Despite taking a lot of practice, it has been incredibly enjoyable to learn how to play an instrument for the first time in my life.  Dabbling in a bit of music theory as well has been interesting.  There's so much more to music that I had never been aware of.</p>
